        <h3>Taipei Holy Family Catholic Church</h3>
        <p>
          The Holy Family Church has a unique architectural design. The building is very large and tall, similar to the Living World Mall. However, only one floor is used by the congregation. The second floor above the entrance serves as a storage area for furniture. Upon entering, there are rows of pews for the congregation. In front, there is a large altar. On the left side, there are more seats and a piano. To the left, where I was seated, there is a statue of the Virgin Mary and several candles. On the altar, there is a statue of God that appears to be floating, along with a large painting of Him. The interior features large wooden strips that extend up to the ceiling in an X-shape, and in each space between the strips, there is a painting of God. On the right side, there are colored stained-glass panels in square shapes. 
          The Holy Family Church has stood for 72 years, since 1953. It was founded by two Canadian priests and one Italian priest. In 1964, the church was blessed and officially began to be used. The church building was renovated in 2020 and completed in 2023. Today, the church serves as a center for the Catholic community in Taiwan. Inside, there is a large painting and statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary. The church also has a devotional room. Every week, 1500 people attend mass in Mandarin, English, and Taiwanese. Next to the church stands the mosque of Taipei.
          The Holy Family Church has a more modern and taller design, while Saint Laurensius Church is more traditional with Roman architecture details but also tall. The Holy Family Church has a spacious and wide interior, with a painting of God hanging above the altar. Saint Laurensius Church features more ornaments and stained glass but also has a large wooden statue of God hanging on the cross. The statue of Mary at the Holy Family Church is placed on the left side of the altar, while in Laurensius, it is located in a special chapel. At the Holy Family Church, they use Mandarin, English, and Taiwanese during services. At Saint Laurensius, we only use Indonesian.

        <h3>Community Service Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          First, we were given an explanation about the history and process of recycling. Then, we were divided into several groups to carry out our respective tasks. I was assigned to sort the trash. I took waste from the pile and separated it into several categories, such as plastic bottles, paper, and so on. After that, I separated the plastic bottles from their caps because they are made of different materials. I also removed the plastic rings from the bottle caps.

The purpose of this activity was to raise awareness about recycling. I believe this purpose was achieved because I completed my task. As a disciple of God who denies myself, I chose to set aside my personal desires and follow God’s path in helping others.
This community service activity made the work easier for the older volunteers and was also a form of self-denial for me—choosing not to use single-use plastics so as not to burden the volunteers who handle the recycling. I willingly made sacrifices by working under the hot sun, in a place full of insects and unpleasant smells, just to help others.
I carried the weight of my own laziness and transformed it into dedication that comes from and is for God. Jesus wants His disciples to do good without expecting anything in return. As a disciple who follows Him, my act of helping sort waste was done without expecting any reward.
Besides that, I also became more aware of the negative impact of plastic and how I can stop using single-use plastics continuously. I also learned not to buy things I don’t need, because they’ll only end up as waste and harm the environment.
As a disciple of God who denies myself, I chose to put aside personal desires and follow God’s path in helping others. This community service activity not only lightened the load for older volunteers, but also taught me to avoid single-use plastics as a form of self-sacrifice. Jesus calls His disciples to do good without expecting anything in return. As someone following Him, I helped sort waste without expecting anything back, because I believe true kindness is priceless.
